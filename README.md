# Python Inception

Python is a dynamically written object-oriented programming language. 
The tutorials are in the sequence of the file name. Sample scripts are located in examples folder. Python used in this 
repository is CPython, that is python interpreter written in C. The code written using Python is compiled in runtime.
The same compiled code is reused multiple times. Hence, Python optimises the execution. For example, constant expressions
and sequences with length less than 20 characters are precalculated and stored. 

Version: 3.8.x
